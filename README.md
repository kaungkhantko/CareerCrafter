# Job Recommender

Job Recommender is a machine learning-based system that recommends job listings to users based on their skills and preferences. The system uses both collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to generate recommendations.

## Installation

To install Job Recommender, you will need Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have Python installed, you can clone the Job Recommender repository from GitHub:

You will also need to install the Python dependencies for the project. You can do this using pip:

cd JobRecommender
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

Job Recommender comes with both a command-line interface and a web interface.

### Command-line interface

To use the command-line interface, you can run the `cli.py` script:

python src/cli.py


The command-line interface will prompt you for your skills and interests, and then generate a list of recommended jobs based on those inputs.

### Web interface

To use the web interface, you can run the `web.py` script:

python src/web.py



This will start a web server on your local machine. You can then access the web interface by visiting http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

The web interface allows you to enter your skills and interests and receive a list of recommended jobs. You can also view your job history and rate job listings.
