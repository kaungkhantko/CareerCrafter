# Job Recommender

Job Recommender is a machine learning-based system that recommends job listings to users based on their skills and preferences. The system uses both collaborative filtering and content-based approaches to generate recommendations. The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate a list of job titles that match the user's skills.
